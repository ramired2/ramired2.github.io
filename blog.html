            <h5 class="prompt Title">Challenges I faced</h5>
                <p class="postText">Rendering the page for the second task was the most complicated and difficult for me.
                    At first, I wasn't able to get the posts to show up at all. I was still confused about the method that
                    I was supposed to be using. The fact that the json data didn't have a name for the array confused me. I was testing
                     some things and found that using [] resulted in the page being rendered, however, three additional empty posts kept showing up.
                      After learning that using 'this' instead of using [] worked as well I played around with it and found 
                      'this.price' looped through it correctly without the three extra posts.
                </p>

        <h5 class="prompt Title">What I learned</h5>
            <p class="postText">I learned how to make a templates and how to use handlebars. Although seemingly difficult topics I was happy to learn that
                they weren't as difficult as I was making it seem.
            </p>

        <h5 class="prompt Title">Resources</h5>
            <p class="postText">For this assignment I used the lecture videos that were posted on hadnlebars. Furthermore, I used stackoverflow and modzilla for two problems
                 that I was having.
            </p>

        <h5 class="prompt Title">What I Googled</h5>
            <ul class="postText">
                <li>How to iterate through a loop when an array name is not given when using #each</li>
                <li>I googled Element.insertAdjacentElement()</li>
            </ul>
